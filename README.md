# Foundry-FundME
In this project, we created a smart contract, and funded it with sepolia Eth, lauched it on test net, and managed other things also, such as minimum amount, restrictions, withdraw etc and also tested the project. this is one my first blockchain project built while following, 37 hour tutorial of patrik collins, the legend. 

## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
